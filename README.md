Collision
=========

A 3D collision-detection library for Elm.

This library uses the [OBBTree](http://gamma.cs.unc.edu/SSV/obb.pdf) algorithm. It is designed to work well for rigid objects &mdash; objects that move and rotate in 3D space, but do not change their shape.

*Caution.* This library is still in the final phase of testing. I am going to announce on elm-discuss when I think it's ready for other people to try out (early July 2016).
